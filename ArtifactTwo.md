## Articfact Two Enhancement: Algorithms and Data Structure

The Project is a calculator with basic functionality that was made more user friendly with a better user interface. The first version of this calculator was very basic with minimal functionality that was not neat for the user and very tiny compared to the current version. This calculator project was first created back in my CS-310 Class. This course was taken near April of 2021. 

This project in my opinion covers the Algorithms and Data Structure subjects very well as a calculator is all about algorithms. This basic calculator is tuned to show that neatness can be beneficial to help please the user in the end project as the first calculator was very messy. I selected this project to add to my eportfolio and redo as an enhancement because I enjoyed doing this project a lot and I think tuning it to make it look better and to include a bit more mathematics compared to the first version was very useful. Adding functionalities like multiply and divide as well as a percent button (that does not work yet) is a good way to show how the calculator project can provide assurance to the algorithm’s selection. 

I think redoing this project helped me relearn Java a bit. I don’t think I’m the best at Java but I think doing this project really helped me experience more and rethink my strategies on approaching these kinds of projects and touchups. I very much enjoyed this project because math is one of my favorite subjects (though I’m not as good at it as I used to be) and so it had a special place in my heart to work on this project. I faced challenges getting the percent button to work but other then that the project ran smooth!
