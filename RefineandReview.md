## Refinement Plan & Code Review

### Artifact One: Software Engineering/Design
My first artifact that I will be choosing to work on in regard to the Software Engineering/Design Category is my 3D Chair made in OpenGL last semester for CS 330. This work was done for my final project for the 330 class, and I plan on trying to make it better then it already is. The plan I have is to adjust the lighting and possibly the background to make the chair pop more as well as possibly give the chair more definition than it already has. Using the skills, I learned in CS 330 such as camera movement and the code to create my actual object I do plan to refine and make this better. 

### Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
The second artifact that I will be choosing to work on is my CS 310 basic calculator. This will be used to demonstrate Algorithms and Data structures. I will try to enhance this calculator by making it from a basic calculator to a more advanced calculator with more buttons and functions then it already has. I believe that a calculator can show Algorithms and Data Structures well.
	
  
### Artifact Three: Databases
My Third artifact that I will be working on is a self-made database using C# in Visual Studios. Right now, it is only a database that when ran you can see the database in its entirety, but I will be trying to add a user interface to search for specifics to find a needed item in the database. Of course, this will cover category 3 for Databases and as well as trying to make it more user friendly, I will also add more to the database in regard to identities and even more subjects.
