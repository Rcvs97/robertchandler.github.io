# Introduction 
I started my path in the Computer Science program on January 9th, 2019. I started as an undecided major back in 2015 attending a community college at my old home in New York. Nassau Community College was not the place for me to grow and I knew it from the beginning of that journey. I failed out of this school and years later decided I decided I knew I wanted to pursue a Computer Science degree but was unsure of where to do so. After doing some research I found that SNHU had a great Computer Science Program and that is where I decided to begin my path. I am now planning to graduate in May of 2022!


# Self-Reflection
While at Southern New Hampshire University, following the Computer Science program has taught me many things that I plan to carry in my future endeavors. I think two important things that the program has taught me as a whole are
1.	Saving my work
2.	Comment/Label your code/work

Saving your previous work and projects may have benefits down the line as it can help provide details in which you may need for a different project. Taking old work and reusing it/replicating it is often used today by developers. You never know when you might need to go back and check/use your work so always save it whether on a local device or GitHub. 

Commenting and labeling code should be a fundamental everyone follows. This is because it is useful to you and other developers who may need to go over your work and fix a bug that may be caused b your work. It labels the section of where certain activities are fired and being able to locate where the source is located is very useful. 

Reviewing and testing your code shouldn’t even be stated as a necessary topic because it is too obvious that it is necessary. Reviewing and constantly testing your work like I did throughout the program, should be done many times throughout a project. This is because if you wait until the end of the project or wait to long to test you are bound to have multiple issues in the code where you’re not sure where they may intertwine with later code. 


# Summary of My Portfolio
I believe that the course I’ve taken throughout the computer science Program has given me the basic necessary fundamentals needed to help progress myself into a career work environment. In this E-Portfolio the courses I will be demonstrating my skillsets include:
- CS310: Creating a Calculator using Java
- CS330: Using OpenGL to create a chair
- And a self-Project: A database using Visual Studios

Of course, my skillset does not just include these assets as I have taken other classes, however I chose these course and project because they are more recent than others and I do feel as my memory on other subjects has faded unfortunately. 

In the CS310 project for creating the calculator, I had basic functions of a calculator including PLUS, MINUS, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, AND SQUARING. In my build I plan to incorporate more functionality to my calculator and adding more functionality for the user such as square root, power, and many more. CS330. I have completed already for creating a chair in OpenGL Visual Studios. Previously the chair had no background and poor lighting. In my adjustments I created better lighting and allowed the user to change the background using the number pads. 1-9 has a different color value and whatever the user would like to add would be changed in the viewport. And lastly my self-project includes a basic Database created in Visual Studios. I plan to add a User Interface which allows the user to search for Database subjects. The database is used to store Employee data. 

I believe that each of these projects are diverse in their own way and each show how I have grown throughout the program.
