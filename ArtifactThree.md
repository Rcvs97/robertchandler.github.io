## Articfact Three Enhancement: Databases

The artifact I selected for to enhance in regard to Databases Is a self-project that started off as just a graph that displays a Database full of employee data such as their position, name, phone number, and salary. This Was then enhanced to add a user interface in which the user can search things in said database and add to it if need be. This artifact was created at the beginning of this course. 

I believe that a self-project that was improved such as this one should be displayed in my eportfolio. I think adding the features that I did to search information in the database is essential in certain criteria today. I added a search function to search up data that is in the database to pull up the data in regard to what is being searched. For example, if you needed to find an employee(s) based on their position, you can type the position and all of the employees with that position will appear with their other information such as name, phone number, and salary. 

I havenâ€™t worked with databases in a while and losing my previous work/projects effected this outcome with a self-project which is a challenge on its own. I think with this project time and information was not on my side though starting this project early on in the course helped as I learned most of what I needed from online sources.
