##Articfact One Enhancement: Software Engineering & Design


The artifact from the beginning is the use of OpenGL to create chair. The artifact at first was just a chair the user is able to go through and move around using WASD keys. It was created in CS330 a couple of months ago. What I adjusted in the current form of the artifact from the previous one was adding a background color and changed the lighting of the viewport. The background color can now be adjusted by the use of the number pad adding a different color for whatever number the user chooses. 


I chose this artifact to include into my portfolio because it shows that I have capabilities in OpenGL, and I still have the experience from what Iâ€™ve learned. I also enjoyed doing the research in order to complete the tasks and additions I completed. I believe changing the look and feel of the background and lighting are small adjustments though they are important in some respects. 


I learned how to adjust the lighting and add a background color based on the users input of the number pad. Learning this from the internet was very difficult however it was fun! I was having issues trying to add the background color input as I continuously made mistakes in the code. However, after this was fixed, I had no complications!
